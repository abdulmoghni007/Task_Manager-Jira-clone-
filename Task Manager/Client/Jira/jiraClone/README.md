# JiraClone

It is designed to manage tasks, track progress, and organize workflows for teams. The clone typically includes features such as:
Issue Tracking: Users can create, assign, and manage issues or tasks. Issues can be categorized into types like bugs, features, and improvements.
User Roles and Permissions: Allows different levels of access, such as admins, developers, and project managers.
Search and Filters: Advanced filtering and search functionality to find tasks based on criteria like assignee, status, or priority.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
